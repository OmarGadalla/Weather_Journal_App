<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
This Project's main focus is on Nodejs, Express, APIs & Asynchronous functions.
A starter code was provided by Udacity, the objective was to make requests to openweathermap.org using user-defined zipcodes, save the data on the server,
then fetch the data from the server and use it to update the UI on the page.
